# Overview

This is a basic breakdown of the different functions required to make a game.
If you want, you can just copy this into your [areas.js](/js/areas.js) file and edit it later.

### Notes:

 - Even though this tool doesn't require you to have any previous coding experience, understanding how and why it works will be a lot easier if you already know the basics of JavaScript.
 - For making more advanced games (for example with custom functions and variables), it is suggested to have at least some form of previous coding experience.

### Code Overview:

(Text after a "//" just means that it's a comment and won't change anything in the code.)
```
// Game Info

setGameInfo({
    name: "My Grindcraft Game",                         // The name of your game!
    version: "0.1",                                     // The current version of your game!
    icon: "images/system/blank.png",                    // Link or path to an icon image for your game!
    ID: "myGrindcraftGame",                             // Your game's ID! Should be unique for every game!
});

// Resources

addResources(                                           // Function for adding all the resources (items/tools/buildings) that are used in your game!
    {
                                                        // Look in the resources docs for more information about this.
}
);

// Areas

addArea("c",                                            // Function for adding a new area. The "c" is the area ID. This should be unique for all the areas in your game!
{
    name: "City State",                                 // The name of the area.
    image: "images/areas/cityState.png",                // The image of the area.
    unlocked: true,                                     // If true, the area will be unlocked when you start the game. The first area should always be unlocked!
    updateWhileUnactive: true,                          // If true, grinds in this area will still give you resources when you travel to another area.

    grinds: [                                           // List of all the different grinds in this area.
                                                        // Look in the grinds docs for more information about this.
    ],

    crafts: [                                           // List of all the different crafts/recipes in this area.
                                                        // Look in the crafts docs for more information about this.
    ],
}
);

```
