# Advanced use of the Grindcraft Game Maker tool

To add custom function and variables to your game, you first have to know how all the player stats are being saved.

### The player object

Everything in your game is saved in the `player` object. Knowing how it looks and how it works is useful for creating advanced games.

```
player = {
    // Player stats
    currentArea: 0,                                         // The location in the areaList of your current area (0 is the first value.)
    resources: {                                            // List of all your resources
        dirt: {
            image: "images/dirt.png",
            amount: 3,
        },
        stick: {
            image: "images/stick.png",
            amount: 1,
        },
        planks: {
            image: "images/planks.png",
            amoun: 0,
        },
    },
    variables: {                                            // List of your custom variables
        normal: {
            coolVariableName: 2,
        },
        static: {
            universalConstant: 42,
        },
        temp: {
            timeSinceOpened: 150,
        },
    },
    areaList: ["c", "i", "b"],                              // List of all the areaIDs

    // Areas
    c: {                                                    // All the area info is saved here
        name: "City State",
        image: "images/areas/cityState.png",
        unlocked: true,
        updateWhileUnactive: true,

        grinds: [
            // etc.
        ],

        crafts: [
            // etc.
        ],

        update(diff) {

        },
    }

    i: {
        // etc.
    }

    b: {
        // etc.
    }

    // Unlocked grinds and areas
    unlockedAreas: ["c", "i"],                              // List of the unlocked areaIDs
    unlockedGrinds: {
        "c": ["surface", "caves", "farm"],                  // List of the unlocked grinds in the "c"-area
        "i": ["frozen lake"],                               // List of the unlocked grinds in the "i"-area
    },

    // FPS counter
    currentTicks: 53,
    currentTime: 436,
    lastScreenUpdate: 1657816061456,

    // Settings
    maxFPS: 100,
    showGrindMats: true,
    showCraftRecipes: true,
    enableAutobuys: true,
    autoSave: true,

    // Checks
    saveGotten: true,                                       // Will be true when your save has been received
    switchArea: false,                                      // Will be true while switching area

    // Tool and game versions
    toolVersion: "1.0",                                     // The current version used of the Grindcraft Game Maker tool
    savedToolVersion: "1.0",                                // The tool version used in the save code

    gameInfo: {
        name: "My Grindcraft Game",
        version: "0.1",                                     // The current version of the game
        icon: "images/system/blank.png",
        ID: "myGrindcraftGame",
    },

    savedGameVersion: "0.1",                                // The game version used in the save code
};
```

 - If you for example want to check how much dirt the player has, you could get it by typing `player.resources.dirt.amount`.
   - For multiple words in the resource name, type `player.resources["crafting table"].amount`.
 - If you want to access the different grinds/crafts, and maybe change them, you could type `player.areaID.grinds` or `player.areaID.crafts`.
   - To access a specific grind, you just add the location of the grind in the `grinds` list: `player.areaID.grinds[0]`. The same goes for crafts.
     - (Counting in lists starts at 0, meaning the first item has an *index* of 0, the second an index of 1, etc.)

### Custom variables

For more advanced games, it might be useful to create your own variables to store different stats/values for even more functionality. If you want to create a variable, you have to use the `addVariables` function:
```
addVariables({
    coolVariableName: {                             // Name of the variable
        value: "Test",                              // The variable value
        type: "normal",                             // The variable type
    },
    test2: {
        value: 2,
        type: "temp",
    },
});
```
Here, i've added two variables: One with name `coolVariableName` and value `"Test"`, and one with the name `test2` and the value `2`. The value can be anything you want, from text, to numbers, to arrays, and even objects or functions.

You might also notice the `type` property. This just tells the tool how to save and use the variable:
 - `normal` just means a normal variable. The value can be changed whenever you want, and it will be saved when closing the game. If you change the value of a normal variable inside the `addVariables` function, the value in the player's save won't change. To change the value, you have to manually change it in a function, like the `update` function.
 - `static` means that the variable shouldn't be changed, but remain static. The variable will not be saved when closing the game, meaning if you change the value in the `addVariables` function, the variable's value will also change.
 - `temp` is basically the same as static, meaning it won't save when closing the game, and will change by changing the value in the `addVariables` function. The difference is just that `temp` variables are allowed to be changed, while `static` variables should not.

To access a variable, you just type `player.variables.<variableType>.<variableName>`!
- For example: `player.variables.normal.coolVariableName` would return `"Test"`.

**Notes:**
 - Any new properties added to variable objects will be added automatically to the player save by the tool.
 - Any new values added to variable arrays, will not be added automatically to the player save.

### Official functions & custom functions

Each area has its own `update` function that will be run every frame, as long as the `updateWhileUnactive` property is true:

```
update(diff) {                  // diff is the time in milliseconds since last time the update function was run.
    console.log(diff);
},
```

If `updateWhileUnactive` is false, the function will only run while you're currently in this area.

This can be used for anything you want, and is useful for checking the current amount of resources, or checking if the player is currently grinding a resource.

The `onLoad` function is runned once after opening the website, before the `screenUpdate` function starts:

```
function onLoad(oldVersion) {
    // If the game version in the player's save is not the same as the current game version:
    if (oldVersion !== player.gameInfo.version) {
        // Write it to the console
        console.log(oldVersion);
    }
}
```

This function is mainly used for fixing player saves when something has been changed between updates that might cause them to break.

Of course, you can also make your own functions. Just add them to your [areas.js](/js/areas.js) file, or make a separate .js file for your own functions.
Then, you can use either the `update` function, or the `runFunction` property in crafts, to run the function.

### Other useful functions

Some other useful functions that you can use in your game are the `randomRange`, `randomFloat` and the `randomRound` functions:

 - `randomRange` has two parameters: `(min, max)` and will return a random integer from `min` to `max`
   - Example: `randomRange(2, 5)` returns a random number from 2 to 5
 - `randomFloat` also has the same parameters, but it will instead return a random number with two decimal digits
   - Example: `randomFloat(1.2, 3.5)` returns a random number from 1.20 to 3.50
 - `randomRound` only has one parameter: `(number)`. It will randomly round the number up or down, depending on the decimal digits
   - Example: `randomRound(1.3)` has a 30% chance of rounding up to 2 and a 70% chance of rounding down to 1

### Saves

The save codes are encoded to Base64, using the `encodeSave` function. The code is then saved to `localStorage.<Your game ID>`.
When you import a save, the code is then decoded using the `decodeSave` function, before the data is added to the player object.

These functions can be used if you want to manually change or check your save, by copying your save from the settings and running this function in the console: `decodeSave("<Your save code>");`
